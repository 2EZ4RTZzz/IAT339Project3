              <p>
                This is an RPG-style narrative story game that I worked on individually for the final project of IAT313.
              </p>
              <p>The project was collected by the SFU and recorded on the official SIAT website for the showcase</p>

                    <h2>Concept:</h2>
                    <p>This is a narrivate linear RPG game story , the player have to find a  way to fight with monsters and save the princess at the end</p>
                    <h2>Design process:</h2>

                    <p>IAT 313 is a video eidt course but the prof told me that i can make it by the game as long as close to the final project topic
                    , so i decided to create a unqiue special game for my final project. The final project is about a narrivate linear story.
                    So i spent 1 day to watch the youtube about how to design and create the game with the correct game engine.
                    After that , i drawed my own storyboard to make sure my project is fit to the project requriment.
                    </p>
                    <p>After 20 hours of hard work, I successfully completed the game, posted it on the website, invited many students and friends to test the game, and then obtained feedback from the testers to modify and improve the values of the game, and finally submitted my work that I thought was satisfactory, and successfully won the school Showcase award.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Problem:</h2>
                    <p>1. Initial problem: I think this assignment is a challenge for me to make a game that can be played by all players in a short time, and I don't use the game engine to build a complete game. </p>
                    <P>
                        2. Post-problem: When the game was finished, I invited numerous friends to participate in testing the game. The testers found a lot of game bugs. Some bugs will cause the game to not work correctly. For this kind of problem I do not know how to solve, only through a lot of information and watch videos to learn and fix the bugs.
                    </P>
                    <p>3. Game balance problem: After I modified some vicious bugs, I invited more testers to play the game again, and this time the tester feedback a new problem is about the game challange balance, in some cases, the monsters can easily beat the player, making the game extremely difficult.
                        â€‹To figure out this problem, I conducted a game balancing study to make the game difficulty suitable for most players.</p>
                    <p>4. Play problem: After finishing the game, I found a way to successfully publish the game online and adjusted the game's adaptive environment to ensure that players can play the game on different platforms (PC, Moible, Ipad...etc).</p>
